## FAQ

### Can I use my own data?

Yes, you are welcome to analyze your own data.
Please bring a VCF file to the workshop.

**Important:** 
- Do not filter the VCF file beforehand; we will learn how to filter it together during the workshop.
- If you have a large VCF file, such as whole-genome data, consider using a portion, like one chromosome, to start. Once you are comfortable, you can run the analyses on the full VCF file.


### Do I need a laptop or a server?

You can use either a laptop or a server for all tasks. Our toy example can be run on just a laptop. However, we recommend using both: run small examples on your laptop for practice and quick testing and use the cluster for larger analyses. Ensure the necessary software is installed beforehand.

### What software do I need to install?

Detailed instructions on the necessary tools and installation will be sent one to two weeks before the workshop. It is important to have the tools installed beforehand to maximize our time during the sessions.

### Will there be any hands-on exercises?

Yes, the workshop includes hands-on sessions where you can apply the techniques learned during the lectures.

### What skills are required?

Basic command line knowledge is reqiured, as we will use command line tools during the workshop.

### What is the purpose of the Q&A session on Monday?

The additional Q&A session on Monday allows participants to discuss any remaining questions, receive clarifications, and review results.
You can run demographic inference on a cluster over the weekend, and we will check the results together on Monday.


### Will there be materials available after the workshop?

Yes, all workshop materials will be shared with participants afterward.
