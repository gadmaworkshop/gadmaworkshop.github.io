## Details

* **Date & Time:** 18-19 October 2025 (9:30 – 16:30) with additional Q&A session on 20 October
* **Format:** On-site
* **Where:** University of Edinburgh (Room details will be announced later)
* **Registration Deadline:** 10 October
* **Fee:** Free of charge

## What You Will Learn

* **Demographic History Representation**: Start with [demes](https://github.com/popsim-consortium/demes-python) to visually and textually represent demographic histories, helping you interpret results and create clear, informative figures
* **Data Preparation**: Learn how to prepare your sequencing data for effective demographic inference, ensuring accuracy and reliability in your analyses
* **Site Frequency Spectrum Construction**: Use [easySFS](https://github.com/isaacovercast/easySFS) to build a site frequency spectrum, an informative summary statistic for demographic inference
* **Demographic History Inference**: Apply [GADMA](https://github.com/ctlab/GADMA) to infer complex demographic histories

You are welcome to analyze your own data (please see FAQ for the details).
If you do not have any data, we will provide a toy example dataset for practice.


## Session Timings

The two-day workshop will take place on 18–19 October, with two sessions each day:

* **First session**: 9:30 – 12:30
* **Lunch break**: 12:30 – 13:30
* **Second session**: 13:30 – 16:30

## FAQ

### Can I use my own data?

Yes, you are welcome to analyze your own data.
Please bring a VCF file to the workshop.

**Important:** 
- Do not filter the VCF file beforehand; we will learn how to filter it together during the workshop.
- If you have a large VCF file, such as whole-genome data, consider using a portion, like one chromosome, to start. Once you are comfortable, you can run the analyses on the full VCF file.

### Do I need a laptop or a server?

You can use either a laptop or a server for all tasks. Our toy example can be run on just a laptop. However, we recommend using both: run small examples on your laptop for practice and quick testing and use the cluster for larger analyses. Ensure the necessary software is installed beforehand.

### What software do I need to install?

Detailed instructions on the necessary tools and installation will be sent one to two weeks before the workshop. It is important to have the tools installed beforehand to maximize our time during the sessions.

### Will there be any hands-on exercises?

Yes, the workshop includes hands-on sessions where you can apply the techniques learned during the lectures.

### What skills are required?

Basic command line knowledge is reqiured, as we will use command line tools during the workshop.

### What is the purpose of the Q&A session on Monday?

The additional Q&A session on Monday allows participants to discuss any remaining questions, receive clarifications, and review results.
You can run demographic inference on a cluster over the weekend, and we will check the results together on Monday.


### Will there be materials available after the workshop?

Yes, all workshop materials will be shared with participants afterward.
