## Overview

Welcome to the virtual workshop on Demographic Inference using GADMA! This workshop is designed to introduce researchers to GADMA, a powerful command-line tool for the automatic inference of the joint demographic history of multiple populations from genetic data.

## Objectives

This method gives you a copy of the Petridish repository and website. You can then **update** content and settings, and **remove** all the files you don't need.

1. Go to the [Petridish repository](https://github.com/peterdesmet/petridish/) and click the green button `Use this template`. Give your repository a name and description (can be changed later).
2. Go to your repository settings and enable GitHub Pages (`http://github.com/username/repository/settings/pages`). Use the `main` branch as source.
3. Check your site at `http://username.github.io/repository` (give it a minute to build).
4. See [configuration]({{ '/docs/configuration/' | relative_url }}) to update elements of your site.
5. Since you copied the Petridish repository, the theme is verbosely included. If you opt to make use of the `remote_theme` option described above, you can safely remove:

    ```
    _includes/
    _layouts/
    _sass/
    assets/theme/
    package-lock.json
    package.json
    petridish.gemspec
    screenshot.png
    ```

## Registration

If you do not what to use `remote_theme`, see the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#understanding-gem-based-themes) to install (gem-based) themes.
